Software systems centered around databases have become pervasive in a wide variety of applications, including health-care management, e-commerce, business processes, scientific workflows, and e-government. Such applications support complex workflows involving numerous interacting actors, whence the critical need for various analysis tools. Unlike arbitrary software systems, data-driven applications are increasingly specified using high-level logic-based tools, which greatly facilitates the analysis task. This new opportunity has given rise to a flourishing research area at the intersection of databases and computer-aided verification, in both academia and industry. This will be an overview of work done in this area at UCSD and in collaboration with INRIA over the past decade.
